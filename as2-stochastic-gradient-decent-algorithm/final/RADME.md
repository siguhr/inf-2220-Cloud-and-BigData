Run inplementation:
1. run "$python3 matrix.py" in terminal
2. The terminal willprint the error value for every 50 iteration

Adjust parameters:
1. adjust percentage of NAN at line 172 in matrix.py
2. adjust learning rate at line 189 in matrix.py
3. adjust iterations at line 190 in matrix.py

Outcome:
1. The plotted graph will shov x-line: iterations and y-line: error value 
2. the printed matrix (top) represent the first and last line of the estimated error values 
3. the printed matrix (bottom) represents the first and last line of the original error values
